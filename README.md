# Cloud Control
 
This is the first game I ever published to Itch.io. It is also the first game I made to have sound.

In the game there is a plane that is "out of control" (that was the theme for a game jam I saw) and thunder clouds are moving towards it. To keep the plane alive, you have to drag away the clouds, so the plane doesnt crash into it.
its basically like an endless runner except you move the obstacles instead of the player.
